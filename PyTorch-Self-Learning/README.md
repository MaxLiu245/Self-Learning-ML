# README

All details are showed in `MorvanZhou_Tutorials.ipynb` and others are support materials (no need to discover).

# Note

1. My developing environment is Win-10 with CUDA itself, using `Python 3.7` and `Anaconda 3`.

2. I noticed that some notes in `ipynb` is small. It's because I used LaTex format there, you can reproduce them clearly in your notebook interactive environment.
